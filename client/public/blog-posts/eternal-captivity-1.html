							<p class="excert">
								Can history be changed? One ill-fated orca named Lolita starred in the anti-animal
								cruelty
								movement in the 21st century. Half a century ago, Lolita was abducted from the wild,
								which
								was her only home. Since then she has been imprisoned, been alone, exploited for
								entertainment, and tired of life. 51 years ago, on August 8th, orca hunters kidnapped
								and
								sold baby Lolita to the Miami Seaquarium. Lolita was captured by money hungry people and
								has
								endured starvation and abuse. She constantly reminds us of the horrible evolution of
								animal
								entertainment. When did we turn this ruthless? Before being a prisoner, Lolita swam to
								her
								heart’s desire, around the globe. Now, at Miami Seaquarium she is forced to swim at the
								tank’s longest yet undesirable length, only 4 times her body length.

							</p>
							<p>
								When she was named by the seaquarium, her captive life began. At only four years old,
								she
								was kidnapped from her family and held hostage at Miami Seaquarium’s single tank. She
								tolerated pain and torture for more than 90% of her life. The deepest point of Lolita’s
								tank
								in Miami is just 20 feet unlike the hundreds of miles in the ocean. Her tank is not the
								only
								issue, but her physical health, mental health, and performances are also concerning. The
								oceanarium claims that Lolita is monitored under first-class veterinarian care, but in
								reality, Lolita is far from being healthy. For one, her teeth have been drilled, filled,
								and
								cut; it’s a common problem among captive orcas due to frustration and the urge to
								escape.
								Lolita suffers teeth damage and infections caused by drilling the teeth and exposing
								pulp
								cavities. Furthermore, Lolita is given unrequired antibiotics, antifungals, pain
								medication
								(including narcotics), steroids, hormones, and antacids to treat ulcers. Often she was
								given
								drugs without any medical evidence proving that they were required. Hidden records
								recovered
								by PETA show that she was given at least one medication every day. Obviously, the vast
								amount of medications that Lolita was given on a regular basis confirms that Lolita is
								not
								healthy. According to PETA, all of the treatment that she receives is for illnesses
								caused
								by captivity. In compensation for all of Lolita’s suffering, you would think that Lolita
								has
								company in her tank, but she has no company. Yes, Lolita has been in solitary
								confinement
								for the past 51 years. Human interaction inside her tank has also been minimized because
								people labeled her as an aggressive and dangerous “monster.” This takes a toll on
								Lolita’s
								mental health. She has been going crazy to say the least. Lolita shows signs of
								“zoochosis,”
								which, to put it simply, is excessive boredom. With all these problems, Lolita is still
								forced to do at least 2 performances per day and perform unnatural tricks including
								flips
								above water which harm an orca in the long run. The trainers at the oceanarium never let
								their audience know any of this information during shows because of the fear that they
								may
								lose business. Despite many legal issues that the Miami Seaquarium faced regarding the
								size
								of Lolita’s tank, they never enlarged it due to the expense of renovation.


							</p>
							<p>
								Want to help this lonely orca? Animals has got the best way to help Lolita. Lolita does
								not
								need to spend the rest of her life imprisoned, we can still free her from her depressing
								tank at Miami Seaquarium. Any captive orca can not be set free into the ocean, but
								rather to
								seaside sanctuaries. This is because the orca spends the majority of its life in
								captivity,
								so it does not learn the basic skills needed to survive in the wild like hunting. The
								Whale
								Sanctuary Project promises a solution for other captive orcas like Lolita by
								constructing
								seaside sanctuaries with over 11 acres of space. Seaside sanctuaries are not only for
								orcas
								but other large whales like belugas. We cannot achieve our goal of helping move Lolita
								without your support. Please sign the petition to help change Lolita’s destiny. Also,
								consider donating to The Whale Sanctuary Project to help the organization build more
								seaside
								sanctuaries. Every person and every penny makes a difference for the voiceless. Let’s
								all
								come together to make a meaningful change for these Lolita and other animals facing the
								same
								reality as her. Become a voice for the voiceless today!
