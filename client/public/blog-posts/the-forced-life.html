							<h3 class="mt-20 mb-20">The Forced Life</h3>
							<p class="excert">
								Imagine yourself forced into a tiny box for long periods of time and then punished
								severely
								due to frustration that erupts because of being squeezed into small areas. I would
								assume
								you would say, “No one deserves such a reality,” but unfortunately, this is the truth,
								as
								orcas endure many physical and mental issues solely for our entertainment. SeaWorld
								announced in 2016 the end of its orca breeding; however, as of 2021, there are twenty
								orcas
								in SeaWorld parks, and orca shows are continuing to be performed. These last remaining
								captive orcas are not being benefited by human care and should be released into seaside
								sanctuaries immediately.
							</p>
							<p>
								Orcas at SeaWorld are forced into miniature tanks unlike their natural vast amount of
								space
								in the ocean. For example, an orca named Lolita is 21 feet long, and she lives alone in
								a 35
								feet wide and 20 feet deep tank for forty years at SeaWorld. In the film, Blackfish,
								Eric
								Walter was a trainer who spent time with Tilikum, an orca, and recalls that SeaWorld
								stored
								him at night in a module which was 20 feet across and 30 feet deep, barely giving him 4
								feet
								of extra space for two-thirds of his childhood life. Confined spaces that captive orcas
								live
								in are known to play a huge factor in depression and boredom because orcas can not
								perform
								their regular daily activities as they would in the wild, causing a highly intelligent
								animal to face increased stress.

							</p>
							<p>
								SeaWorld’s creation of synthetic families to make the best show possible causes the
								death
								toll among captive orcas at SeaWorld to rise. According to John Hargrove, a former
								SeaWorld
								trainer, “SeaWorld claims that the orcas are in their family and they have their pods,
								but
								in reality, the captive orcas are grouped in tanks with all animals, part of different
								cultural subsets, they have different communication ways, which leads to whale-on-whale
								aggression.” SeaWorld is responsible for the many deaths associated with quarrels
								between
								unique orcas, so SeaWorld’s care for their orcas is not beneficial because they force
								the
								animals into danger, even when aware of the consequences. Orcas often swim hundreds of
								miles
								to escape a violent encounter with another orca in the wild, but congested spaces at
								SeaWorld cause orcas to fight due to the limited space to flee. Trainers often discover
								the
								orcas covered in teeth rakes revealing flesh and blood, and sometimes orcas have been
								found
								at SeaWorld missing whole pieces of flesh because of violent interaction between tank
								mates.
								One horrific example of aggression between the animals at SeaWorld was in 1998 when a
								female
								orca, Kandu, was irritated by a male orca, Corky, so she smashed into Corky’s head,
								resulting in a ruptured artery in Kandu’s jaw. Kandu bled out for forty-five minutes
								continuously and spurt blood out from her blowhole, and died as trainers watched her in
								agony helplessly.
							</p>
							<p>
								SeaWorld’s apparent first-class care for its orcas is a fallacy as their orcas face many
								rare health problems and body transformations. In the wild, orcas spend ninety-five
								percent
								of their time in deep oceans to shield themselves from the sun, but orcas at SeaWorld
								live
								in shallow pools with water infused with chemicals, so they frequently experience
								sunburns.
								A rare phenomenon among wild orcas that regularly occurs between captive orcas at
								SeaWorld
								is dorsal fin collapse which hosts a pathway for illnesses. In the wild, dorsal fin
								collapse
								occurs in only one to five percent of male orcas, but at SeaWorld, all male orcas have
								dorsal fin collapse due to lack of waves and ocean currents to structure the dorsal fin
								upright. Captive orcas have dental difficulties because they bite on concrete and iron
								bars
								out of boredom, stress, and nervousness; this fractures their teeth and requires
								tormenting
								dental drilling without anesthesia. At SeaWorld, an orca named Kotar was engrossed with
								biting and yanking on the metal bars of the gate surrounding his tank, and in 1995 the
								gate
								fell on him, smashing his skull and killing him within seconds. Biting the concrete bars
								makes the teeth devoid of a filling or cap which causes the tooth to be vulnerable to
								pathogenic invaders, resulting in infections, abdominal organ damage, and premature
								death.
								In 1985, aquatic animal veterinarians Andrew Greenwood and David Taylor published a
								study
								which discovered that fifty percent of dead orcas in captivity died due to bacterial
								infections like pneumonia. SeaWorld’s orcas are not being benefited by human
								interference
								because the orcas endure many damages due to captivity, not seen in the wild.
							</p>
							<p>
								SeaWorld’s merciless acts of family separation to maximize profits are sorrowful as
								these
								orcas deserve to be with their families. For example, Kasatka, the mother orca, and her
								calf, Takara, were very close and inseparable; yet, in 2003, SeaWorld decided to move
								Takara
								to another location to which Kasatka wildly reacted by screeching and crying for four
								months
								in efforts to communicate with her daughter. This is just one example of family division
								at
								SeaWorld, as orcas are separated from each other and often kidnapped from their pods in
								the
								wild. Families stick together in the wild, but as a result of family detachment in
								captivity, these orcas face depression to combat their inner struggles, which is the
								opposite of what human care should achieve.
							</p>
							<p>
								Although these captive orcas at SeaWorld deserve to be released into the ocean for
								completely freedom, it would be life-threatening because majority of these orcas were
								born
								in captivity, making them dependent on humans, so releasing them into the wild would be
								illogical because they do not have basic skills that are necessary to survive in the
								wild
								like hunting. The Whale Sanctuary Project finds a simple solution to this controversial
								topic, which is to shift these orcas to seaside sanctuaries for more space and the
								opportunity to allow orcas to explore their natural habitats while providing them with
								care.
								Seaside sanctuaries are a better alternative to concrete tanks offered at SeaWorld
								because
								orcas at the sanctuaries would not suffer from depression or various health issues.
							</p>
							<p>
								SeaWorld promises its remaining twenty orcas are the last generation of captive orcas;
								but,
								SeaWorld’s care for its orcas is ineffective and detrimental. Orcas at SeaWorld are not
								being benefited by human care because they are imprisoned in tanks less than twice their
								size, put in unnatural family groups leading to deadly aggression between orcas, obtain
								sunburns, suffer dorsal fin collapse, are depressed, endure dental problems, have
								premature
								death because of microbial infections, and are separated from families. Captive orcas at
								SeaWorld should not be released into the wild because it is dangerous, but should be
								moved
								to seaside sanctuaries constructed by The Whale Sanctuary Project. Animal abuse must no
								longer continue to occur as animals are entitled to freedom and have authority to
								exercise
								that right. Do not wait for the change, but become a part of the movement and help
								change
								the fate of these orcas.
