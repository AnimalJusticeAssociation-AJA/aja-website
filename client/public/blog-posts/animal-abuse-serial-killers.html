							<h3 class="mt-20 mb-20">The Hidden Connection Between Young Animal Abusers and Serial
								Killers
							</h3>
							<p class="excert">
								“I always had the desire to inflict pain on others… I always seemed to enjoy everything
								that
								hurt,” remarked Albert Fish, an infamous and despised serial killer, rapist, and
								cannibal.
								We often consider serial killers as the worst people to step foot on Earth; however, we
								never take time to reflect on what birthed such evil personalities. When we take a
								closer
								look at serial killers and the creation of such personas, animal abuse is the most
								common
								theme.
							</p>
							<p>
								While the link between the two may seem illogical, it remains undisputed that animal
								cruelty
								at a young age creates more murderers; however, the main reason for this odd yet
								historical
								relationship is violence. This brutality originates from an addiction to torturing
								innocent
								animals. For example, in Romania, strays are branded as vermin and rounded up for
								ruthless
								killing by the government, leading to a practice of killing innocent, unfortunate
								animals.
								The situation grew so uncontrollable that the European Court of Human Rights was
								eventually
								called in to fix this situation.

							</p>
							<p>
								Similarly, domestic violence towards women is standard in Romania as a combined 84
								percent
								of the population say violence is “fairly common.” In both of these cases, there is a
								connection: Romania's high stray murder and violence rates make the youth more likely to
								witness animal cruelty and subsequently become more aggressive.
							</p>
							<p>
								While some may argue that exposing adolescents to animal cruelty cannot create something
								nearly as horrible as murderers, a Romanian study indicated that adolescents exposed to
								animal cruelty showed suicidal or violent behavior. As a result of witnessing animals
								suffering constantly, the teenage brain becomes accustomed to experiencing violence and
								injuries to themselves and others. Teens who observe constant animal abuse become more
								likely to believe that self-harm and unfair treatment is typical.
							</p>
							<p>
								History provides multiple specific examples of this scenario. To start off with, Jeffrey
								Dahmer practiced cutting dogs and cats and ended up murdering and cutting off the limbs
								of
								17 people. In a similar sense, Ian Brady started boasting about killing a cat at the
								young
								age of 10. Later, he went on to kill several other animals such as dogs, cats, and
								rabbits
								before choosing to sever multiple people’s heads. Lastly, two people who enjoyed
								brutality,
								Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, used to tie rabbits to railways and shoot pigeons for
								no
								apparent reason. Months later, they went on to abduct, torture, and murder a toddler.
							</p>
							<p>
								To add to this, twenty-five percent of aggressive inmates have committed animal abuse as
								adolescents. This includes those who have not been convicted of murder. Similarly,
								forty-five percent of school shooters are known to have committed animal cruelty. And
								finally, twenty-one percent of serial killers have admitted to childhood animal abuse.
								This
								excludes those that have abused and denied any abuse towards innocent animals. Due to
								these
								statistics, stories, and historical links, it can be assumed and proven that animal
								abuse
								should be considered as an early indicator of a future murder, rape, or assault.
							</p>
							<p>
								Animal abuse itself is a horrible act; however, its consequences affect many others in
								the
								long term, as shown. There is a fundamental connection between killing animals and
								killing
								innocent people; serial killer mindsets may not only affect clueless beings but even you
								as
								well. To prevent this mindset from further spreading, we must prevent the origin from
								developing. For more information on animal abuse and how to stop it, make sure to check
								out
